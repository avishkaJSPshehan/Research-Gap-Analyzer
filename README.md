## Project Overview
The Research Gap Analyzer is a web-based tool designed to help researchers identify research gaps by analyzing multiple research papers simultaneously. This tool streamlines the literature review process and helps researchers identify potential areas for new research.

## Key Features
- **Multiple PDF Analysis**: Upload and analyze up to 3 PDF research papers simultaneously.
- **Automated Summary Generation**: Get concise summaries of each uploaded paper.
- **Research Gap Identification**: AI-powered analysis to identify potential research gaps.
- **History Tracking**: Save and compare previous analyses.
- **Note Taking**: Add and save notes for each analysis.
- **PDF Export**: Export analysis results in PDF format.
- **Comparison Tool**: Compare different analyses side by side.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Custom CSS
- **PDF Processing**: jsPDF
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Storage**: Local Storage for history persistence
